	---help---
	  CCID-3 denotes TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), an equation-based
	  rate-controlled congestion control mechanism.  TFRC is designed to
	  be reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP-like flows,
	  where a flow is "reasonably fair" if its sending rate is generally
	  within a factor of two of the sending rate of a TCP flow under the
	  same conditions.  However, TFRC has a much lower variation of
	  throughput over time compared with TCP, which makes CCID-3 more
	  suitable than CCID-2 for applications such streaming media where a
	  relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.

	  CCID-3 is further described in RFC 4342,
	  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4342.txt

	  The TFRC congestion control algorithms were initially described in
	  RFC 5348.

	  This text was extracted from RFC 4340 (sec. 10.2),
	  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4340.txt

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  This use is recommended as it is consistent with the initialisation

	  An alternative way of tracking s, also supported by rfc3448bis.
	  This used to be the default for CCID-3 in previous kernels.

	bool "Track the maximum payload length"
	---help---
	  An experimental method based on tracking the maximum packet size.
